## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure consistency and quality in the Serverless Workflow Catalog, please follow these guidelines:

- **Function Naming**: Use lowercase names with alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`) for function directories. Include the semantic version in the directory name (e.g., `1.0.0`).

- **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for your custom function. Include a `README.md` file with information about the function's purpose, parameters, usage examples, and any other relevant details.

- **Ownership**: Create an `OWNERS.md` file to list the individuals or teams responsible for maintaining the function. Include their names and contact information.

- **Code Quality**: Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices. Write unit tests if applicable.

- **Testing**: Test your function thoroughly to ensure it integrates well with the Serverless Workflow DSL and performs as expected.

- **Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the imperative mood and describe the purpose of the commit.

## Review Process

- **Pull Request Review**: After submitting a pull request, repository maintainers will review your changes. They may request modifications or provide feedback.

- **Approval and Merging**: Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main repository. You will receive a notification once this is done.
